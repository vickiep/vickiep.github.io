<p>Voting to <strong>&ldquo;Reject&rdquo;</strong> both of the new proposals is the only way I see to get the time we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time is needed to have the documents reviewed and confirm &ldquo;nothing new&rdquo; as stated.&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears to me and to some other homeowners there are some new things and they are of concern for many of us.&nbsp; With the review, anything that is &ldquo;new&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; compared to our current Articles and Covenants, I&rsquo;d like to point out clearly so each of us understand possible future impacts on our community.&nbsp; Even though the current Board communicated to us they have no plans to hire a Professional Management Company and no plans to Compensate Board members, we need to make sure there is no language in our documents that will allow future Board members to do so.&nbsp; It is shortsighted to only think about today&rsquo;s impacts.&nbsp; What are the possible future impacts?&nbsp; I will take the lead on getting this done and posting updates on my Website that I just had created &hellip;.</p>

<p>Over half of our current Homeowners in this lovely subdivision have owned for over 25 years &ndash; some are original owners since it was built.&nbsp; Many reasons owners choose to stay here include the peaceful beauty, low annual assessments, minimal rules and restrictions, and the overall pride owners display in their properties.&nbsp; A thanks to our Board over the years and to the current one for many of these things.&nbsp; Riding through the community earlier and delivering the flyer asking you to &ldquo;Reject&rdquo; the proposed documents until we have more time to digest them, I met and spoke with some very nice friendly people and realized just how lovely our community is. I didn&rsquo;t see anything that I would want to change.&nbsp; And in reading the posted Board meeting minutes for the last year around only 11 violations were addressed (less than 5% of total lots).&nbsp; For a community of 228 homes this is phenomenal!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not change anything that would change all of this.&nbsp; While there may be some new legal language required by Indiana Law, a simple amendment describing it may be enough.</p>
