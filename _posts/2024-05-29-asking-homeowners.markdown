<h1><strong>Asking other homeowners</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not change anything that would change all of this.&nbsp; While there may be some new legal language required by Indiana Law, a simple amendment describing it may be enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please support me in this effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to create an email address list to notify you of things impacting homeowners. You can provide your email address on my Website if you would like to get email updates.</p>

<p><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
